# Engineering Faculty Labs

Child theme for [Flat Bootstrap](http://xtremelysocial.com/wordpress/flat/), Engineering Faculty Labs gives faculty members the ability to easily create high-quality content for their labs.

## Where in the world can I find this Engineering Faculty Labs theme?

This theme is strategically tucked away in the electronic vaults of [VCU's ALT Lab](http://altlab.vcu.edu/), so only the fine folks working for VCU's School of Engineering can partake in its beauty.

## So how do I get it?

First off, you will need to have created an account on the ALT Lab hosted WordPress server, [https://rampages.us/](https://rampages.us/).

Secondly, you will need to send an email to Ken Kim <[kimkd@vcu.edu](mailto:kimkd@vcu.edu)> with the following information:

* Your VCU email address (yes, this seems redundant, but completely necessary)
* The URL of your blog/website
* Whether you want to make this theme your *active theme* or just *make it available in your theme list* 

I know the last thing you want to do right now is wait for a go-ahead response, so let's not do that. Now is as good of a time as any to brush up on those WordPress skills with some [lynda.com](https://lynda.com) videos like this one: [WordPress Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/WordPress-tutorials/WordPress-Essential-Training/372542-2.html).

## I have access to the theme, now what?

Congratulations, now the fun begins! Go ahead and login to your [Ram Pages Dashboard](https://rampages.us/wp-admin/) and navigate to your site's WordPress dashboard. From here, navigate to `Appearance -> Themes`. If you requested the theme to be made available in your list, perform a page search (that's `ctrl+f` for you Windows folks) for Engineering Faculty Labs and click the respective `Live Preview` button. If you went all-in on the theme and already have it activated, you'll find it in the first position with a `Customize` button â€• Go ahead and click that.
